  <p>
    Hi, you are reading our content, nice! We're surprised you even found our website, since it is so boring and bland. 
    Of course you would rather go on Google or Youtube. This might be a complete waste of time just for you to read
    this. All we actually do is put up random sport gifs that MAY make your day. Yes, we are the funniest people ever lol. 
    So here we go peeps, welcome to sports
